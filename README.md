## üëã About me

I have been a full-stack web developer since 2009, with a strong foundation in self-taught skills and incomplete formal studies in computer science. My passion for technology has driven me to constantly learn and refine my expertise in various web development technologies.

In 2021, I transitioned into the public sector, joining the General Administration of the State as an IT Assistant. This shift paused my professional coding journey until recently, when I secured a position at the Central Traffic Headquarters, where I aim to continue developing and expanding my skill set.

In my spare time, I indulge in the nostalgia of retro consoles and 8-bit microcomputers from the '80s, particularly the ZX Spectrum. I appreciate the artistry and gameplay that defined that era. I also enjoy playing the classical guitar, despite not being an expert. Music serves as a wonderful outlet for expression and relaxation, complementing my technical pursuits.

### üíª Technologies I'm Interested In

| Technology | Reason                                         |
| :--------: | :--------------------------------------------- |
| PHP        | I like PHP, especially for backend development. |
| Symfony    | I like Symfony as a PHP framework because of its vast ecosystem of small components. |
| Node.js    | I like Node.js for backend development because of its vast ecosystem and seamless integration with the frontend. |
| Vue        | Vue is perfect as a powerful and lightweight framework for frontend development. |
| C++        | C++ is my go-to language for maximizing optimization in development, as is often required in applications for microcontrollers like Arduino or ESP32. |
| Go         | Go is simple and efficient, and I love its concurrency handling. It's ideal for small microservices development. |
| Python     | I like Python for web development, web scraping, and also for its vast set of tools for working with AI. |
| Godot      | Programming games with this IDE/framework is a lot of fun. |
| Rust       | Rust is the only one on this list that I haven't had time to try yet, but I'm very interested in its strong emphasis on safe memory management. |
