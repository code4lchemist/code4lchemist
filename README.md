## About me

I have been a full-stack web developer since 2009, with a strong foundation in self-taught skills and incomplete formal studies in computer science. My passion for technology has driven me to constantly learn and refine my expertise in various web development technologies.

In 2021, I transitioned into the public sector, joining the General Administration of the State as an IT Assistant. This shift paused my professional coding journey until recently, when I secured a position at the Central Traffic Headquarters, where I aim to continue developing and expanding my skill set.

In my spare time, I indulge in the nostalgia of retro consoles and 8-bit microcomputers from the '80s, particularly the ZX Spectrum. I appreciate the artistry and gameplay that defined that era. I also enjoy playing the classical guitar, despite not being an expert. Music serves as a wonderful outlet for expression and relaxation, complementing my technical pursuits.
